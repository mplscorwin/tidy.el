# tidy.el
Tidy.el - from and with patches as found on EmacsWiki

This is Tidy.el by Kahlil (Kal) HODGSON <dorge@tpg.com.au> as found on
the EmacsWiki, here:

http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/tidy.el

I have applied the "parse" patch also from EW, found here:

https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_tidy.el

No other changes apart from twiddling the version in the top comments.
